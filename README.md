# SNHU-CS-210
This project orients around displaying bank account information based on an initial investment amount, monthly deposits into the bank account(assuming there are any), the annual interest rate, and the amount of years the user is looking to see the projected growth of the bank balance. I believe I did a fairly good job creating well organized code to solve this problem optimally. The main difficulty I encountered while working on this project was implementing the use of "this" pointers as it was my first experience utilizing them in C++. In order to deepen my understanding I used a few websites to see examples of their use and applicable implementations. The main skills from this project I developed that are notably transferable to other projects I have worked on would be the use of "this" pointers and in general becoming more accustomed to Object Oriented Programming. I generally try my best to make my code very readable as I often get lost when debugging my code. I tend to add spaces between grouped lines of code with the obvious addition of comments to ensure looking back through my code is an easy process if I ever need to find anything.
